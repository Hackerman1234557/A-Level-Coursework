# A-Level-Coursework
My Coursework for my A-Level Computing project.
The program  is a Vernam cipher which can encrypt and decrypt user inputted text
using a randomly generated key.
I wrote it in python 3.9 and used pygame for a simplistic GUI.
The function of the program is very simplistic; the key is randomly generated 
from a string containing all the letters in the English alphabet, and each
character in the Plaintext has a corresponding character in the ciphertext
as its key.
